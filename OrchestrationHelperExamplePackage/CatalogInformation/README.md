# OrchestrationHelper - Example

In this example solution for DataMiner, a library was created to easily implement Automation scripts that orchestrate a function of a device, resource or element. The [OnRequestScriptInfo](https://docs.dataminer.services/develop/api/types/Skyline.DataMiner.Automation.AutomationEntryPointType.Types.html#Skyline_DataMiner_Automation_AutomationEntryPointType_Types_OnRequestScriptInfo) entry point is used to detect which values, defined as profile parameters, such a script needs to perform the orchestration.

Details about the scripts and their use case are available in the repository of the example: [https://github.com/SkylineCommunications/SLC-S-OrchestrationHelperExample](https://github.com/SkylineCommunications/SLC-S-OrchestrationHelperExample?tab=readme-ov-file#technical-documentation-for-the-orchestrationhelper-example).
